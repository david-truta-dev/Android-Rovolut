# Android-Rovolut

The basic ideea of the project is a **"production-ready" banking app (aka Revolut clone) in terms of Android development practices**.
<br><br>This project which is supposed to showcase my skills, but also help me learn the very best practices while developing. This will include proper security measures that are used in today's banking applications and it will also ilustrate the best Android development practices used in the industry.

#### TODO next:
<ul>
<li> setup different environments (dev, staging, prod)
</ul>

##### Wanted features:
<ul>
<li> custom in-app force update mechanism (this will display when there is an update available for the app. Mandatory updates do not let the user access the app unless he updates)
<li> choosing light theme and dark theme (the user can switch between)
<li> detect rooted users, and don't allow them to access the app.
<li> use biometrics option for access into the app.
</ul>
