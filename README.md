# Android-Rovolut

Hi, this project which is supposed to showcase my skills, but also help me learn the very best practices while developing a banking app. 
The basic ideea of the project is a banking app (aka Revolut clone). 
This will include proper security measures that are used in production banking apps today.
And it also ilustrates the best practices of Android development.
